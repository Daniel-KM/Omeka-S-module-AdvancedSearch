Advanced Search (module for Omeka S)
====================================

> __New versions of this module and support for Omeka S version 3.0 and above
> are available on [GitLab], which seems to respect users and privacy better
> than the previous repository.__

[Advanced Search] is a module for [Omeka S] that adds search capabilities to the
public interface of Omeka S, in particular search autocompletion, filters and
facets. Furthermore, it provides a common interface for other modules to extend
it (forms, indexers, queriers). It can be displayed as a block on any page too.
Besides, it adds some features to the standard advanced search form.

Here is a live example:

![example of search page](data/images/search_page.png)

It can be extended in two ways:

- Forms that will build the search form and construct the query.
- Adapters that will do the real work (indexing and querying).

The default form answers to most of the common needs. It can be configured in
the admin interface to make it a basic form _à la_ Google, or to build a
complex form with or without auto-suggestion, advanced filters, sort fields,
facets, collection selector, resource class selector, resource template
selector, properties filters with various input elements, like numbers or date
ranges.

An internal adapter is provided too. It uses the internal sql api of Omeka to
search resources. So the search engine is the sql one, without indexer, so it is
limited strictly to the request like the standard Omeka S search engine (no
wildcards, no management of singular/plural, etc.). Nevertheless, it provides
the facets to improve the results (requires the module [Reference]).

An adapter is available for [Solr], one of the most used search engine.

For the standard advanced form, it adds some fields to the advanced search form
to make search more precise.

Added fields are:

- before/on/after creation/modification date/time of any resource
- has media (for item)
- has original
- has thumbnail
- multiple media types (for item)
- multiple media types for media (included in core since Omeka S 2.0.2 for a
  single value)
- visibility public/private
- media by item set

Moreover, it adds new search query type for properties:

- start with
- end with
- in list (via api only).
- exclude one or multiple properties (except title)

Finally, an option allows to display only the used properties and classes in the
advanced search form, with chosen-select.


Installation
------------

The module uses an external library [jQuery-Autocomplete], so use the release
zip to install it, or use and init the source.

* From the zip

Download the last release [AdvancedSearch.zip] from the list of releases (the
master does not contain the dependency), and uncompress it in the `modules`
directory.

* From the source and for development:

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `AdvancedSearch`, and go to the root module, and run:

```sh
composer install --no-dev
```

See general end user documentation for [Installing a module].

### Optional dependencies

- Module [Reference] to display facets in the results with the internal adapter.
  It is not needed for external search engines that can manage facets natively.
  It should be at least version 3.4.16.
- Module [Search Solr]. Note that this is not the module [Solr of Biblibre],
  that is named "Solr".


Quick start
-----------

The default search engine is automatically added to the sites.

The main admin menu `Search` allows to manage the search engines and the search
configs: an instance of Omeka can contain multiple engines, for example to hide
some fields in the public front-end, and multiple configs or pages, for example
a single field search and an advanced search with filters, or different
parameters for different sites or different resource types (items or item sets).

An engine and a page for the internal adapter are automatically prepared
during install. This search engine can be enabled in main settings and site
settings. It can be removed too.

To create a config for a page with a search engine, follow these steps.

1. Create an engine
    1. Add a new engine with name `Internal` or whatever you want, using the
       `Internal` adapter. The engine can be set for items and/or item sets.
    2. The internal adapter doesn’t create any engine, so you don’t need to
       launch the indexation by clicking on the "reindex" button (two arrows
       forming a circle).
2. Create a config for a page
    1. Add a page named `Internal search` or whatever you want, a path to
       access it, for example `search` or `find`, the engine that was created in
       the previous step (`Internal` here), and a form adapter (`Main`) that
       will do the mapping between the form and the engine. Forms added by
       modules can manage an advanced input field and/or filters.
    2. In the config of the page, you can enable/disable facet and sort fields
       by drag-drop. The order of the fields will be the one that will be used
       for display. Note that some indexers may have fields that seem
       duplicated, but they aren’t: some of them allow to prepare search engines
       and some other facets or sort indexes. Some of them may be used for all
       uses. This is not the case for the internal indexer, since there is no
       index.
       For example, you can use `dcterms:type`, `dcterms:subject`,
       `dcterms:creator`, `dcterms:date`, `dcterms:spatial`, `dcterms:language`
       and `dcterms:rights` as facets, and `dcterms:title`, `dcterms:date`, and
       `dcterms:creator` as sort fields.
    3. Edit the name of the label that will be used for facets and sort fields
       in the same page. The string will be automatically translated if it
       exists in Omeka.
    4. There are options for the default search results. If wanted, the query
       may be nothing, all, or anything else. This option applies only for the
       search page, not for blocks.

3. In admin and site settings
    1. To access to the search form, enable it in the main settings (for the
       admin board) and in the site settings (for the front-end sites). So the
       search engine will be available in the specified path: `https://example.com/s/my-site/search`
       or `https://example.com/admin/search` in this example.
    2. You can specify to redirect the item-set page to the search page, as in
       the default Omeka (item-set/show is item/browse).
    3. Optionally, add a custom navigation link to the search page in the
       navigation settings of the site.

The search form should appear. Type some text then submit the form to display
the results as grid or as list. The page can be themed.

**IMPORTANT**

The Search module  does not replace the default search page neither the default
search engine. So the theme should be updated.


Internal engine (mysql)
-----------------------

The module is provided with an adapter for mysql. In order to get all features,
you need two other modules.

- The facets work only if the module [Reference] is enabled.


Standard advanced search form and api
-------------------------------------

The fields that are added to the advanced search form are available in the api
and some other ones are available too.

### Api

- `datetime`, that is a list of arrays with keys `field` ("created" or "modified"),
  `joiner` ("and" or "or), a `type` ("lt", "lte", "eq", "gte", "gt", "neq", "ex", "nex")
  and a value ("2021-08-23 12:34:56"), partial or not.
- `resource_class_term`, the term can be a single class term or a list. It is case sensitive for now.
- `has_media` for items.
- `has_original` for items and medias.
- `has_thumbnails` for items and medias.
- `item_set_id` for medias.
- `media_types` for items.

### Exclude properties

To exclude properties to search in, use key `except`. For example, to search
anywhere except in "bibo:content", that may contains ocr or full text, use this
api query `https://example.org/api/items?property[0][except]=bibo:content&property[0][type]=in&property[0][text]=text to search`, or in internal api:

```php
$query['property'][] = [
    'joiner' => 'and',
    'property' => '',
    'except' => $excludedFields,
    'type' => 'in',
    'text' => "text to search",
];
```

The excluded fields may be one or multiple property ids or terms.

The title cannot be excluded currently, because it is automatically added by
the core.

### Visibility

The visibility check may not working if the api url contains `&is_public=&`:
`is_public` must not be a empty string. See the patch in https://github.com/omeka/omeka-s/pull/1671.
This patch is integrated in module only for url, and for call to internal api.

This fix has been integrated in Omeka v3.1.


Search api
----------

The search engine can be used not only for the classical search page, but for
any other views too where you the search of items need to be done quickly, for
example the block layouts with a big database (more than 10000 to 100000 items,
according to your server and your collections).

To use this feature, a config should be created with the form `Api`. This form
is not a true form, but it allows to map the Omeka metadata and properties with
the fields indexed by the search engine. It allows to define a max number of
results too, that is used when no paginator is enable. The argument `limit`
cannot go further.

When ready, the api search is available via multiple means.
- Add `index=1` as query in the block layouts that use it, like [Browse preview].
- Do a standard search with `$this->api()->search()` with the value `'index' => true`
  appended to the argument `$data` or `$options` (recommended when possible to
  avoid to mix the query and the parameters).
- Do a standard search in the theme with the view helpers `$this->apiSearch()`,
  and `$this->apiSearchOne()`, that have the same arguments than `$this->api()->search()`
  and `$this->api()->searchOne()`. The result is an Omeka Response.
- Use the controller plugins `$this->apiSearch()` and `$this->apiSearchOne()`.
- The main api manager understand these arguments too.
- If the api config is made available on a site, it will be a quick access to
  the results at `/s/mysite/api_search_page`.

Note that some features may be not available in the external search engine. In
particular, some events are not triggered.


Indexation
----------

The indexation of items and item sets is automatic and all new metadata can be
searched in the admin board. Note that there may be a cache somewhere, and they
may be not searchable in the public sites.

So when the item pool of a site or the item sets attached to it are modified, a
manual reindexation should be done in the Search board. This job can be done via
a cron too (see your system cron).

Furthermore, there may be an indexation delay between the moment when a resource
is saved and the moment when it is fully available in the search engine (it may
be some minutes with Solr, according to your configuration).


TODO
----

- [ ] Update to remove features integrated in Omeka S v 3.1 and remove dead fixes
  for Omeka S beta.
- [x] The override of a search query with "property" should be called even with
  "initialize = false" in the api.
- [x] Remove distinction between advanced and basic form: they are just a list
  of elements.
- [ ] Simplify the form with https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-form/v3/form-creation/creation-via-factory/
  and js, storing the whole form one time. See UserProfile too.
- [ ] Normalize the url query with a true standard: Solr? Omeka S?, at the
  choice of the admin or the developer of the forms and queriers? Avoid to
  multiply query formats. Probably replace the custom one by the Solr/Lucene one.
- [x] Genericize the name of the fields of be able for internal querier to use
  or convert the fields names.
- [ ] Make the search arguments groupable to allow smart facets: always display all
  facets from the original queries, with "or" between facets of the same group,
  and "and" between groups. Require that the core api allows groups.
- [ ] Integrate auto-suggestion (or short list) to any field.
- [ ] Use the Laminas config (ini/json/xml) to allow complex form (see User Profile)
- [ ] Use the standard view with tabs and property selector for the page creation,
  in order not to limit it to Dublin Core terms. The tabs may be "Filters",
  "Facets", and "Sort".
- [ ] Create an internal index (see Omeka Classic) or use the fulltext feature
- [ ] Move all code related to Internal (sql) into another module?
- [ ] Allow to remove an index without removing pages.
- [ ] Allow to import/export a mapping via json, for example the default one.
- [ ] Add an option to use the search api by default (and an option `'index' => false`).
- [ ] Set one api page by site and a quick set in the pages settings.
- [ ] Update index when item pool of a site change.
- [ ] Genericize and move the value extractor from module Solr to module Search.
- [ ] Improve the check of presence of an item in sites for real time indexation.
- [ ] Updated index in batch, not one by one.
- [ ] Add an option to replace the default Omeka search form.
- [ ] Improve the internal autosuggester to return the list of next words when space.
- [ ] Use a "or" for facets of each group.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check

This module is a merge of features from the deprecated modules [Advanced Search Plus],
[Search] and [Psl Search Form] and derivative ones.

The Psl search form and the Solr modules were initially built by [BibLibre] and
were used by the [digital library of PSL], a French university. Next improvements
were done for various projects. The auto-completion was build for future digital
library of [Campus Condorcet].
